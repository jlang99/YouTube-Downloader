# YouTube Downloader
Downloads Youtube Videos as Highest Video Quality or Audio Only

# Bare Minimum Needs
You only need the YouTube Downloader.exe at a minimum to operate this program.

# Settings File
I have provided an example settings file, but the program will generate one specific to your file environment. I have only tested this on windows 11, but I expect it to work on all windows systems. 
The program provides the User with 2 entry boxes, which contain the default save path's for audio files and video files. Once the program is closed, the last written path in those entry boxes is saved to the Youtube Downloader Settings.json file, that way you last folder used is saved for next time the program launches. If you want to manually rewite the file path in the Youtube Downloader Settings.json file then make sure that the program is not open or it will save over what you wrote. 

**This file must remain in the same folder/directory as the YouTube Downloader.exe file**

# Getting the Icon to Work
You will need to download the YouTube.ico file, or create your own with [https://www.icoconverter.com/](url) and name it "YouTube". The YouTube.ico file is initially expected to be in the same folder/directory as the YouTube Downloader.exe file.
The Icon path can only be changed by manually rewriting the file path in the Youtube Downloader Settings.json file.
